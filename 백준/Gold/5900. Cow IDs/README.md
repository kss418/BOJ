### 문제 설명

<p>Being a secret computer geek, Farmer John labels all of his cows with binary numbers.  However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels cows with binary numbers that have exactly K "1" bits (1 <= K <= 10).  The leading bit of each label is always a "1" bit, of course.  FJ assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest possible valid label -- a K-bit number consisting of all "1" bits.  Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: please determine the Nth label he should assign (1 <= N <= 10^7).</p>
